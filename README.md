This project contains different models for image classification. Specifically, contains three models: 

- A logistic regression model.
- A shallow neural network model.
- A deep neural network with L layers. 

The models are built from scratch using `numpy`. The objective is to gain intuition about how the internals of 
neural networks works, with concepts as forward propagation, backward propagation, and gradient descent optimization. 

This is a self guide project for learning, while taking some courses about deep learning, and implementing 
those concepts on my own environment.

The idea is document a binnacle of the process and find out what went wrong after finish it.
